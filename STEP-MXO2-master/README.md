# STEP-MXO2 Development Board
The STEP-MXO2 Dev Board is a small, breadboard friendly 40-pin DIP form factor board built around Lattice MachXO2 FPGA. 
The board includes 
a USB-JTAG programming circuit, clock source,
two digital displays, 
three RGB LEDs, 
four push buttons, 
eight LEDs, 
four switches, 
one hard-core SPI, 
one I2C, 
and basic I/O devices. 
These components make it a formidable, compact, platform for digital logic circuits and Micro32 embedded soft-core processor designs using Lattice Diamond development software. 
There are 36 Digital FPGA I/O signals (30 GPIOs, four dual-functional pins default to SPI interface, 
and two dual-functional pins default to I2C interface) that are routed to 100-mil-spaced through-hole pins so that you can integrate your programmable design directly into a solderless breadboard circuit. 
At just 0.72 inch by 2.05 inch, it can be loaded in a standard socket and used in embedded systems.

* Easy to use, small form factor and low cost – STEP-MXO2 Dev Board is a breadboard friendly 40-pin DIP form factor board build around Lattice’s award-winning MachXO2 FPGA.
* Rich features and expandable options – On board JTAG programming circuit, 36 Digital FPGA I/O signals, one IP-core SPI interface and one I2C interface that are routed to 100-mil-spaced through-hole pins so that you can integrate your programmable design directly into a solderless breadboard circuit. It can also be loaded in a standard socket and used in embedded systems.
* Learning materials suitable for FPGA learners – A variety of learning materials, including QuickStart guide, user manual, schematic document and demos are provided. Introductory FPGA training courses are available to those who are new to the FPGA world.
